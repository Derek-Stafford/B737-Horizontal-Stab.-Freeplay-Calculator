*Note: 

• Calculator 1: A bit more simple and basic
• Calculator 2: Adds better structuring with the help of dictionaris
• Calculator 3: The most complex of the three and makes use of tables
Description:

 A python-based code that I wrote to help calculate and verify the pass/fail values based on given criteria for a horizontal stabilizer freeplay check on Boeing 737NG, 700-900 series aircraft.  The if/else statements make it easier to see what portions of the check pass or fail based the given limits for each value without flipping back and forth to check the original values. All variables and formulas, except for the x and y variables, are dervied from the appropriate AMM/Routine Maintenance Task Card.
Things I learned: 
  1. Different ways to round decimals
  2. How to allow the user to input          decimal values
